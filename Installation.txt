The setup for our site is mainly controlled by an IDE called PyCharm.

These are the steps to get you up and running with the server and be able to run the site locally in your browser.

The main process of getting the site running is installing python and all the neccessary packages our site uses with the python 3.6.1 interpreter.


1) Download python 3.6.1: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-361/
	- Once installed to verify the version, run python -V (notice the capital V) or python --version via command line.

2) Download PyCharm (Professional)
	- This download has a 30 day trial period which should be more than enough for running the site.
	- MAC: https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-professional-2017.2.dmg
	- Windows: https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-professional-2017.2.exe
	- Linux: https://download.jetbrains.com/python/pycharm-professional-2017.2.tar.gz

3) Upload Project to PyCharm (via GitHub): https://github.com/Joosshhhh/GeekText.git
	- What's nice about PyCharm is you can easily import the project via version control like GitHub.
	- When you open up PyCharm you'll see an option Check out from Version Control, click this and then select GitHub. 
	- For Git Repository URL uses the link above and then configure your directories however you'd like. We named our project GeekText.
	- Click yes if it ask Would you like to open the project.

4) Configure python interpreter in PyCharm
	- Now that the project has been loaded you must configure the project's python interpreter in your PyCharm IDE.
	- In the top left click File -> Settings -> Project:<The Name of the Project> -> Project Interpreter.
	- Then at the top you'll see Project Interpreter dropdown, which you should select 3.6.1.
	- Don't close this window for the next step.

5) Installation of required packages
	- At the Project Interpreter window you'll see a list of packages with name, installed version, latest version available.
	- To install a package you'll see a green plus + on the right, which will open another window to search for packages.
	- Search and install each package from Required Packages below, as they are required to be able to run the site error free.
	- Note at the bottom there is an option to install a specific version, check this and install the packages with the specific versions below.
	- Also some packages are dependent on other packages so you may see others installed, they will install automatically when installing the ones below. 
	- Once you're done installing all the packages for the interpreter, click OK to save the changes.

REQUIRED PACKAGES
	- Django 			1.11.2
	- authorizenet 			1.0.14
	- django-avatar 		4.0.0
	- django-countries		4.6.1
	- smartystreets-python-sdk 	3.0.0

6) Configure Django local server to run the website
	- In the top navigation menu click Run -> Edit Configurations
	- From here click the green plus + in the top left to add a new server and look for Django server.
	- Name the server GeekText and make sure the check box Run browser is checked. 
	- Note you may need to change the port from 8000 to another if you're using 8000.
	- Finally make sure the python interpreter for this server is the same 3.6.1 for the project and click OK to save the changes

7) Running the website locally
	- At last the last step!
	- You can run the project with Run -> Green Play Button in the top navigation
	- Alternatively you can just click the Green Play Button on the top navigation (on the right side)
	- To stop the server you can Run -> Red Stop Button or all the way to the right click the Red Stop Button (left of the search icon)
	- Alternatively a panel might pop up from the button which you can Stop and Run the server by it's buttons on the left (after you've ran the server once).
